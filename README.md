## Description
This Cloud Formation Custom Resource provides a CRUD interface to the New Relic [NerdGraph (GraphQL) Tagging API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-tagging-api-tutorial) for Cloud Formation stacks.

(For performance reasons CloudFormation _List_ is not a supported operation.)

Key:
- R- Requird
- O- Optional
- Blank- unused

### EntityGuid
The New Relic Guid of the Entity that is manipulated. Must be provided for all operations.

### Guid
`Guid` this is to satisfy CloudWatch, ignore it

### Tags
An array of Tag Objects

### Tag Object
A JSON or YAML array of objects consisting of a 
- Key
- Values an array of string values to associate with the Key

See the example below

### Semantics
This flag controls how the Resource interacts with New Relic:
- `AWSSemantics` (default) follows typical CloudWatch semantics and is fairly close to 'normal' Map semantics
  - Create: remove the Key if it already exists and write the new value(s) in its place
  - Update:
    - Key present: delete the Key and replace it (same as Create)
    - Key not present: fail with NOT_FOUND
  - Delete
    - Key present: delete the Key and value(s)
    - Key not present: fail with NOT_FOUND
- `NewRelicSemantics` 
  - Create: if the Key already exists _add_ the new values to the existing key, otherwise a normal 'create'
  - Update: replace the _entire_ existing tag set with these tags
  - Delete: delete any matching key

### Variables
`Variables` is a JSON object of key/value pairs (string/string) that are substituted in the `DashboardInput` string with [Moustache](#Moustache) allowing for parameterized dashboards at the CloudFormation level.

## Moustache
All text substitution is done using a [Go implementation](https://github.com/cbroglie/mustache) of the [Moustache specification](https://github.com/mustache/spec)`. [The manual is here](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html), in
general all you need to know is use triple curly braces.

## Example
An example of a YAML configuration, this is valid and works:
```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Description: Sample New Relic Tagging Template
Resources:
  Dashboard1:
    Type: 'newrelic::cloudformation::tagging'
    Properties:
      APIKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      EntityGuid: "YOUR_ENTITY_GUID_HERE"
      Tags:
        - Key: "Template-Key1"
          Values: [ "Template-Key1-Value1-Create", "Template-Key1-Value2-Create" ]
```

## Important Notes
- Key values are _case sensitive_, `ThisIsAKey` *is not* the same as `thisisakey`.

## Troubleshooting
- Error log
- `Debug` log level for mustache substitution
- Validate mutation using the [Explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql)

## Building
- Install Docker
- Install Golang
- [Install the CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CFN-CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/what-is-cloudformation-cli.html)
- `make clean build `

## Testing
- Start Docker
- Activate `cfn-cli`, usually `source ~/.virtenv/aws-cfn-cli/bin/activate`
- Build and start the container `make clean build ; sam local start-lambda --warm-containers eager`
- Run the [CloudFormation Contract Tests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/contract-tests.html) `cfn test`

## Publishing
```bash
# Double check the resulting zip file for security leaks!
cfn submit --dry-run
# Send the resource to AWS, the result is a private resource
cfn submit --set-default --no-role --region us-east-1
# Test the private resource with the sample template to ensure it works
aws cloudformation deploy --region us-east-1 --template-file template-examples-live/sample.yml --stack-name tagging-test-stack
# Tell AWS to run the Contract Tests, required for going public
aws cloudformation test-type --region us-east-1 --log-delivery-bucket newrelic--cloudformation--custom--resources --arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:830139413159:type/resource/newrelic-cloudformation-tagging
# Check the result
aws cloudformation describe-type --region us-east-1  --arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:830139413159:type/resource/newrelic-cloudformation-tagging
# Also the logs are in CloudWatch. They end in .zip but are really gunzip so
# gunzip -S .zip <file>
# Publish the extension publicly AFTER pushing the final version to GitHub AND generating/tagging a release
# IMPORTANT!
#   --public-version-number (string)
#   The version number to assign to this version of the extension.
#   Use the following format, and adhere to semantic versioning when assigning a version number to your extension:
#     MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
#   For more information, see Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 .
#   If you donâ€™t specify a version number, CloudFormation increments the version number by one minor version release.
#   You cannot specify a version number the first time you publish a type. CloudFormation automatically sets the first version number to be 1.0.0 .
#
# It's a good idea to not publish until everything is ready AND version 1.0.0 is release in Git!
# KEEP IT ALL IN-SYNC!
#
# Git
#
aws cloudformation publish-type --region us-east-1 --arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:830139413159:type/resource/newrelic-cloudformation-dashboards  
aws cloudformation describe-type --region us-east-1 --arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:830139413159:type/resource/newrelic-cloudformation-dashboards
```
### Notes
- If you see an `Exception: Could not assume specified role...` error message in the test log then you probably have a `cfn` generated role and they're not correct. As this resource uses no other AWS resources a Role is not required.
